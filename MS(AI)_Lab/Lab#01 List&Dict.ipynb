The designed system asks the instructor for a record of each student one by one as a console input and passes it through a set of sequential steps before generating a dictionary data structure.\n","\n","Write a Python script to perform following set of operations to generate dictionary of data for students.\n","\n","1. The script should ask the instructor repeatedly for a “student ID”, “name” and his “residential city name” and store it in three different lists. If the instructor types “stop” the loop should exit.\n","\n","2. Traverse the three lists generated in “part 1” and create a dictionary data structure out of it. The script should take ID of student as a Key of the dictionary and rest of the attributes as a list within that dictionary in following sequence: {1:[“name”,”city”]}\n","\n","Once dictionary is created, the instructor should be able to query the data.
